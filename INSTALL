At the moment there's no binary packages available for Steel, so you will need 
to compile Steel from the source code. It's easy and fast. Steel depends on SQLite, 
Mhash and Libmcrypt. Of course also GCC and GNU Make are required.

To install the dependencies on Ubuntu 14.04:

      sudo apt-get install libmhash-dev libmcrypt-dev libsqlite3-dev
    
To install the dependencies on Archlinux:

      sudo pacman -S libmcrypt mhash sqlite
      
To install on OS X:

For OS X, you need to first install libsqlite3 libmcrypt, and have XCode installed

With Homebrew:

	brew install mcrypt sqlite


To install Steel move to Steel source code directory and type following commands:

      make
      sudo make install
    
Steel will be installed on /usr/local/bin/ by default. Man page will be installed 
to /usr/local/share/man/man1/.
